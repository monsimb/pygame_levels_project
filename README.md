# CSCE Club - Pygame Project

## Introduction
Welcome to UNT CSCE Club's collaborative project! We will take submissions for levels to be added to this framework from *all UNT Students*, regardless of your major, experience, or previous membership in the club. The framework currently supports simple, maze-style games, but you can also turn it into a platformer by adding your own features. Please look at [Level Creation](#level-creation) for more details on our guidelines and recommendations!

If you're new to Python or PyGame, follow our [Setup](#setup) and [Compilation](#compilation) instructions. For further help, take a look at the links in [Resources](#resources).

We're excited to see what kind of fun levels, features, and puzzles you all come up with. We will be playing through all of these levels at our last meeting of the semester, so make sure to join our [discord]( https://discord.gg/cvmvAS85Rv) to get updates about that. Thank you for your interest and contributions!
